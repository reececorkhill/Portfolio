# Reece Corkhill's Portfolio

This is my official portfolio repository.

## Description

All web developers must be able to showcase their skills, right? Well, here’s my official portfolio repository.

The aim of this project was to create a functioning portfolio website using HTML and CSS, and include flex and grid. The motivation for doing so is that I wanted to be able to keep track of what I’m learning by showcasing it on a deployed application that can be updated with new technologies, as I learn them.

The problem was, I didn’t have a place to store my portfolio and make it accessible to potential clients or job providers. This problem has finally been solved by creating a structure which allows me to showcase information about me and my projects and also including contact information.
